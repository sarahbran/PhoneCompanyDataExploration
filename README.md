# Phone Company Data Exploration

## Overview
The Phone Company Project was a hands-on learning experience aimed at exploring various types of database joins and practicing schema creation, data insertion, and data extraction. This project allowed me to gain practical knowledge of SQL queries, particularly focusing on left join, right join, inner join, and self join operations. Additionally, I developed and executed additional queries to gain insights from the data.

## Objectives
    • Understand Different Types of Joins: I delved into left join, right join, inner join, and self join to comprehend how each type functions and when to use them effectively.
    • Schema Creation: I designed a robust database schema to efficiently organize and store the phone company's data.
    • Data Insertion: I populated the tables with sample data, mimicking real-world scenarios to simulate a functional database.
    • Data Extraction: I utilized SQL queries to extract valuable information from the tables and draw meaningful insights.

## Project Steps
    • Schema Design: I defined the database schema, outlining the necessary tables, their relationships, and primary/foreign key constraints.
    • Table Creation: I executed SQL queries to create the tables according to the defined schema.
    • Data Insertion: I populated the tables with test data, ensuring representative and diverse entries.
    • Joins Exploration: I practiced various join operations (left join, right join, inner join, and self join) to comprehend their functionality and differences.
    • Data Extraction: I wrote queries to extract relevant information from the tables, such as customer details, and phone call records.
    • Additional Queries: I formulated additional queries to perform data analysis.
